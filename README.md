# ATCSIndProj
Final project for 2024 advanced topics in CS course at Polytechnic
This project was created by Junaid Bhatti Class of 2024

In the past few months, I have occasionally been playing online poker. (WITH FAKE MONEY)
This inclined me to attempt to create a poker game for my final independent project.
I started by making a layout of the things that I thought I would need. These are the 4 classes, Card, Deck, Hand, and Game

The first class card, contains the two variables that make up the card, suit and rank
The suit is defined between one of the four, spade, club, heart, or diamond
The rank is defined between 2-10, as well as Jack, Queen, King, Ace
This deck does not have a joker
